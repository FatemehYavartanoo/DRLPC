# Dimension Reduction using Local Principal Components for Regression-based Multi-SNP Analysis in 1000 Genomes and the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA)
Dimension Reduction using Local Principal Components (DRLPC) is an approach for gene-level association analysis based on Local PCA. DRLPC clusters correlated SNPs, replaces each cluster with a local principal component, and iteratively removes variables with high Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to address multicollinearity. 
Detailed information about [DRLPC: Dimension Reduction using Local Principal Components] can be found in our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.13.593724v1.abstract).
