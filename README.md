# Dimension Reduction using Local Principal Components for Regression-based Multi-SNP Analysis in 1000 Genomes and the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA)
Dimension Reduction using Local Principal Components (DRLPC) is an approach for gene-level association analysis based on Local PCA. DRLPC clusters correlated SNPs, replaces each cluster with a local principal component, and iteratively removes variables with high Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to address multicollinearity.
